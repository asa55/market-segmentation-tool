## How to Use
There are many ways to segment markets. This tool provides the ability to apply custom filters based on your own research or beliefs about categories. In this exercise, the data may not be available, but it is important to itemize your assumptions so that you can refine it as you go along. Much of business is knowing when to pivot - this will help you get an initial impression of whether or not your idea has a market large enough to be worth pursuing (or if you should change your angle).
