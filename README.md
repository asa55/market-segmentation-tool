# Wondering why this repo exists?

I built a tool using codesandbox.io. [Check it out by clicking here](https://z2xy5.csb.app/), if you'd like.

Originally I intended to statically deploy the app using Gatsby (as I did for the class-sre-implements-devops repo).

I might modify this code again in the near-ish future, so I think I'll hold off on the aforementioned thoughts of SSG.

This project depends on:

* CodeSandbox.io
* React
* reCharts
* Material-UI
* colormap

Instructions for use are on the site. Enjoy!
